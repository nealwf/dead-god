# Dead God
## A Binding of Isaac: Rebirth visualization project

Dead God started as a data visualization class project fueled by my love of Rebirth.  It examines the trends in Steam achivements for Rebirth and its DLCs.  I'm expanding it slowly in my spare time to include more visualizations and analysis.  

It's intended to be my personal project, but I would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions.

## To Do
### General
* Update the CSS for smaller screens.
* Add alt text to images.
* Populate Sources page with font, image, and data info.

### Charts
* Update all charts to Vega-Lite. This project was originally built with Chart.JS and Vega-Lite, but Vega-Lite is more flexible.
* Improve interactivity and readability of Rarity Distribution by DLC.
* Add tree diagrams to show what achievements build on each other.
* Add parallel set diagrams for different types of achievements by requirement and unlock, similar to https://cloudred.com/labprojects/nyctrees/.
